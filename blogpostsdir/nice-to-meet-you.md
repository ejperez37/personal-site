wow my first blog post! might as well talk all about myself!

i guess you've already caught my name on the home page, but i can't really get _your_ name, so i'll just call you my faithful reader. so, dear faithful reader, besides me being a web developer, a martial artist, and a huge nerd, what else could there be to me?

quite a lot actually! those are easily understood labels, and us human beings appreciate those. BUT. by no means is that the whole picture. i'm actually kind of "against" labels - at least as far for defining myself. 

there are SO many shades on the spectrum of what being a "martial artist" can mean, for example, so to reduce myself to any singular label, and therefore a stereotype, is just silly in my eyes. you wouldn't be able to know if i were an astute and morally-rigorous student of the combat arts or if i were a meathead that just wanted to stand and throw punches until one of the two men(ignoring the referee) remained standing! quite the disparity. 

so, while i do understand the practical uses of labels, i'm just saying that people place a little _too_ much weight in them. with social media being so ingrained in people's lives, it can feel like people get reduced to their highlight reels and bios. instead, i have found solace in just _being me_. well what does THAT mean, you may ask? 

e.j., or at least the idea of e.j., can be better described with words such as loyal, hard-working, hard-thinking, sometimes hard-headed, etc... but wait are those not labels too? true. at the end of the day, the worth is more then the sum of the parts. to drop the third person speak - i am me. nothing more nothing less. i used to spend a lot of time judging myself and comparing myself to often times unhealthy standards. this led to a lot of unneccessary pain even if it meant i was pushing for improvement.

but, as is true with a lot of things in this life, there is so much more nuance involved with understanding yourself and the concept of an identity and the self-worth one derives from their identity and the choices they make or don't make. (don't even get me started on the prospect of "free will") 

i wake up everyday, i am thankful for the opportunities affored to me in life, i am thankful for the painful lessons i have learned and grown from, and i give what effort i can in order to continue living a life where i get to take care of myself and my loved ones. i focus on what i can control and exercise patience with things i cannot control. i strive to be better while accepting and loving myself for where i'm at now.


this balance escaped me for what felt like forever in my earlier years. i think everyone would benefit from a little bit more balance in their lives. i hope sharing my, admittedly at-times-spaghetti-balled, thoughts can get YOU to think a bit about your situation, and maybe you learn to see things in a new way.
