my first (proper) personal site!

i wanted this to be as honest of a reflection of me as possible.

i believe that the aspects of my life highlighted and the intent with which the code was written showcases what it needs to.

responsive design, accessiblity in mind throughout, and letting the content itself take the main stage - no need for fluff or to overly
dress up the meat and potatoes!
